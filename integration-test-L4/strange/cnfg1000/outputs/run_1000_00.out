This is the tmLQCD lib-wrapper code for twisted mass Wilson QCD

Version 5.2.0, commit 7c4c8ae88db23ab56fadfa875d560297d22f9f45
# the code is compiled for non-blocking MPI calls (spinor and gauge)
# the code is compiled with openMP support
# Non-Schroedinger (anti-periodic, periodic or twisted) boundary conditions are used
# The lattice size is 4 x 4 x 4 x 4
# The local lattice size is 1 x 4 x 4 x 4
# Even/odd preconditioning is used
# beta = 6.000000000000 , kappa= 0.155000000000
