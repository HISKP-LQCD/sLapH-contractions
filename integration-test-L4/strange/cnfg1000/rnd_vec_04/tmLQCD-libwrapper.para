This is the tmLQCD lib-wrapper code for twisted mass Wilson QCD

Version 5.2.0, commit 7c4c8ae88db23ab56fadfa875d560297d22f9f45
# the code is compiled for non-blocking MPI calls (spinor and gauge)
# the code is compiled with openMP support
# Periodic boundary conditions are used
# Even/odd preconditioning is used
# The lattice size is 4 x 4 x 4 x 4
# The local lattice size is 1 x 4 x 4 x 4
# g_beta = 6.000000000000 , g_kappa= 0.155000000000, c_sw = -1.000000000000 
# boundary conditions for fermion fields (t,x,y,z) * pi: 1.000000 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000
