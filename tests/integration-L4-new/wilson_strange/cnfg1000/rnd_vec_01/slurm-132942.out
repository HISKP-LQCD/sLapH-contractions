# Instructing OpenMP to use 1 threads.
# Creating the following cartesian grid for a 4 dimensional parallelisation:
# 1 x 1 x 1 x 1
# Process 0 of 1 on lnode09: cart_id 0, coordinates (0 0 0 0)
This is the tmLQCD lib-wrapper code for twisted mass Wilson QCD

Version 5.2.0, commit c21ed9222ac9fec7495b2f0153c35482e71a7c22
# The code is compiled with -D_GAUGE_COPY
# The code is compiled with -D_USE_HALFSPINOR
# the code is compiled for non-blocking MPI calls (spinor and gauge)
# the code is compiled with MPI IO / Lemon
# the code is compiled with openMP support
# Non-Schroedinger (anti-periodic, periodic or twisted) boundary conditions are used
# The lattice size is 4 x 4 x 4 x 4
# The local lattice size is 4 x 4 x 4 x 4
# Even/odd preconditioning is used
